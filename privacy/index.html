										comply with them in respect of each individual Game which you choose to access and/or play.</li>

										payment processing partners may have their own terms and conditions and you should ensure you are in agreement with these prior to making any payment. If your transaction with our payment processing partners is not successful then your
										purchase will not be fulfilled. Upon the completion of a successful payment transaction then your purchase will be fulfilled to you as soon as possible - we will endeavor to fulfill your order immediately at the point of purchase.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>3. Accounts<ul>
									<li>3.1 You agree that you shall take all steps necessary to protect your log in details and keep them secret.</li>
									<li>3.2 You agree that you shall not give your log in details to anyone else or allow anyone else to use your log in details or account.</li>
									<li>3.3 In these terms, references to “log in details" or “account" include your log in details and account for any social network or platform that you may allow our Services to interact with.</li>
									<li>3.4 If you fail to keep your login details secret, or if you share your login details or account with someone else (whether intentionally or unintentionally), you accept full responsibility for the consequences of this (including any
										unauthorized purchases) and agree to fully compensate us for any losses or harm that may result.</li>
									<li>3.5 We will not be responsible to you for any loss that you suffer as a result of an unauthorised person accessing your account and/or using our Services and we accept no responsibility for any losses or harm resulting from its unauthorised
										use, whether fraudulently or otherwise.</li>
									<li>3.6 We reserve the right to delete your account if no activity is conducted by you in relation to the account for 180 or more days. In such event, you may no longer be able to access and/or use any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods (as
										defined below) associated with that account and no refund will be offered to you in relation to the same. We also reserve the right to suspend or cancel your account if you are deemed to be in violation of our community guidelines or terms of
										use. In such event, you may no longer be able to access and/or user any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods (as defined below) associated with that account and no refund will be offered to you in relation to the same.</li>
									<li>3.7 You understand that if you delete your account, or if we delete your account in accordance with these terms, you may lose access to any data previously associated with your account (including, without limitation, the level or score you
										have reached in our Games and any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods associated with your account).</li>
									<li>3.8 YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN ANY ACCOUNT THAT YOU CREATE USING ANY OF OUR SERVICES. WE MAY SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY OR DELETE ANY OF THESE ACCOUNTS AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON
										OR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>4. Virtual Goods and Virtual Money<ul>
									<li>4.1 Our Services may include virtual currencies such as Cookies, Coins, or Gems (“Virtual Money") or items or services for use with our Apps (“Virtual Goods"). If you are over 18 years old you may be able to buy Virtual Goods or Virtual
										Money. You agree that once purchased Virtual Money and Virtual Goods have no monetary value and can never be exchanged for real money, real goods or real services from us or anyone else. You also agree that you will only obtain Virtual Money
										and/or Virtual Goods only from us, and not from any third party. You agree that by transferring your Virtual Money and Virtual Goods to other users on the App or websites, that you release your claim to the Virtual Money or Virtual Goods. We
										will not be responsible for any claims arising from such transfers.</li>
									<li>4.2 You do not own Virtual Goods or Virtual Money but instead you purchase a limited personal revocable licence to use them - any balance of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money does not reflect any stored value.</li>
									<li>4.3 You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Money and Virtual Goods are final and that we will not refund any transaction once it has been made. If you live in the European Union you have certain rights to withdraw from distance
										purchases; however, please note that when you purchase a licence to use Virtual Goods or Virtual Money from us, you acknowledge and agree that we will begin the provision of the Virtual Goods or Virtual Money to you promptly once your
										purchase is complete and therefore your right of withdrawal is lost at this point. For the purposes of this paragraph 4.3, a "purchase" is complete at the time our servers validate your purchase and the applicable Virtual Goods or Virtual
										Money are successfully credited to your account on our servers.</li>
									<li>4.4 If you do not connect your game play on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or otherwise linked to your personally identifiable information, we will not be able to restore any purchases to a
										different device if you lose that device or it is damaged. Accordingly, any risk of loss of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money on a device which is not connected in this way is transferred to you upon completion of the purchase as described in
										paragraph 4.3 above.</li>
									<li>4.5 If you live in the European Union, we will provide you with a VAT invoice where we are required to do so by law or where requested by you. You agree that these invoices may be electronic in format.</li>
									<li>4.6 We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without any liability to you.</li>
									<li>4.7 We may revise the pricing for Virtual Goods and Virtual Money offered through the Services at any time. We may limit the total amount of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total amount
										of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods that may be held in your account in the aggregate. You are only allowed to purchase Virtual Money and Virtual Goods from us or our authorized partners through the Services, and not in any other way.</li>
									<li>4.8 Depending on your platform, any Virtual Goods or Virtual Money purchased will be purchased from your platform provider and such purchase will be subject to their respective terms of service and user agreement. Please check usage rights
										for each purchase as these may differ from item to item. Unless otherwise shown, content available in any in-game store has the same age rating as the game.</li>
									<li>4.9 Without limiting paragraph 4.4, if we suspend or terminate your account in accordance with these terms you will lose any Virtual Money and Virtual Goods that you may have and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund
										to you.</li>
								</ul>

								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>21. For residents in the United States-- BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:<ul>
									<li>21.1 These BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or access, download and use our Services in the United States. These provisions may also apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or
										download or use our Services from outside the United States. See JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW below for details.</li>
									<li>21.2 Initial Dispute Resolution: If you have any concerns or queries regarding our Services, our customer support team can be reached via email at support@sleeper.app. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers'
										satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or
										arbitration.</li>
									<li>21.3 Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach a mutually agreed solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the paragraph above, then either party may initiate binding
										arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms and the Privacy Policy (including its interpretation, formation, performance
										and breach), the parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of any of the Games or our other Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive
										Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the
										Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA") shall apply to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and formation of these terms notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in these terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal,
										state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these terms, including without limitation any claim that
										all or any part of these terms or the Privacy Policy is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The
										arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800)
										352-5267. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and, to the extent applicable, the Consumer Minimum Standards, including the then-current limit on
										arbitration filing fees. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in
										court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</li>
									<li>21.4 Location: If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place in San Mateo County, CA. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Mateo County, California, and you and we agree to
										submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Mateo County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered
										by the arbitrator.</li>
									<li>21.5 Class Action Waiver: The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a
										class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE PRIVACY POLICY ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
										OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on
										a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</li>
									<li>21.6 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only
										asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the
										Services under these terms. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</li>
									<li>21.7 30 Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in the "Binding Arbitration," "Location," and "Class Action Waiver" paragraphs above by sending
										written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Blitz Studios Inc., 1900 O'Farrell St, Ste 150, San Mateo, CA, 94403, Attn: Sleeperbot Legal. The notice must be sent within 30 days of the earlier of your first download of
										the applicable Game or commencing use of our Services (or if no purchase was made, then within 30 days of the earliest of the date on which you first download the applicable Game or access or commence use the applicable Service); otherwise
										you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</li>
									<li>21.8 Changes to this section: We will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this Section. Changes will become effective on the 60th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</li>

										other Services will be subject to the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to conflict of laws principles. If any court or arbitrator determines that the “Class Action Waiver" paragraph set forth above is void or unenforceable for
										any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then any and all claims arising out of these terms (including interpretation, claims for breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort
										claims)) shall be decided under the laws of the state where you were a citizen at the time you downloaded, accessed or commenced use of the Service that was subject to these terms. In addition, you and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive

										policy.</li>
									<li>By downloading, accessing and/or playing our games, or interacting with our websites or other Services, you agree to the use of your information in accordance with this privacy policy. If you have any concerns about providing information to

								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>2. What types of information do we collect<ul>
									<li>We collect information from a number of different sources, but most of it comes directly from you when you play our games, or interact with our websites, advertising or other Services. Broadly the information we collect about you relates to
										the type of device you are using, how you play our games (such as usage activity and purchases made), other games or apps you use on your device and may include information that you submit when creating an account with us or which you allow
										us to access when you connect to your social network accounts or other 3rd party accounts through our games or Services. We may also collect information from advertising platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about
										purchases and interests.</li>
									<li>In more detail, depending on which of our Services you interact with we may collect and process the following types of information:</li>
									<li>details about how you use and interact with our games, advertising and other Services (for example, information about how and when you play our games or visit our website(s), what device you use to access our games and services or details
										regarding profile visits, as set out in the section entitled "Sleeperbot Profile" in section 3, below);</li>
									<li>information that you provide us with when you fill in forms, answer questions or complete surveys when using any of our Services, when you create an account with us or if you invite your friends to use our games and Services;</li>

									<li>your interactions with us on our social media channels;</li>
									<li>information we collect via cookies and other similar technologies, as explained further below;</li>
									<li>information we collect from you when you connect our games or Services to third party platforms, websites, or social network services or use other social or player-to-player functionality; and</li>
									<li>information we collect about you from our other group companies or other third party companies (including publishing partners, platforms, advertising platforms and partners and data aggregators) which may include attributes about you and

										the information from you.</li>
									<li>In some instances, when you make purchases on or through our website(s), we may collect certain payment information from you on behalf of our payment service providers, but this information is temporarily cached in a way that is unreadable

										mobile apps (such as those you can purchase in the App Store, on Facebook or on Google Play) we do not collect or store any payment information from you.</li>

										are used.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>3. Creating a Sleeperbot Profile and playing our games socially<ul>
									<li>Sleeperbot Profile<ul>
											<li>When you play our games or access our services, we will give you a unique identifier which we will associate with a Sleeperbot account known as a "Sleeperbot Profile". That Sleeperbot Profile will be specific to the Sleeperbot games
												played on an individual platform or device and will remain anonymous unless you choose to add your personal information to that Sleeperbot Profile. Others players in a game may be able to see your publicly viewable profile, progress in
												the game, reputation on the App, and other information such as your game achievements, but no personally identifying information will be visible to other players. You can choose to add your personal information to your Sleeperbot Profile
												at your own choosing, so that you can be identifiable to your friends.</li>
											<li>Your Sleeperbot Profile and the information it contains, such as your game achievements, in App reputation, etc., will be visible to other users of our services. If you choose to add personal information to your Sleeperbot Profile it
												will be visible to your friends and other players anywhere in the world.</li>
											<li>If you choose to view another individual's profile, that individual and other users of our Services will know that you have visited them because some of your Social Data and a link to your Sleeperbot Profile may be displayed on that
												individual's Sleeperbot Profile. They will also be able to visit your Sleeperbot Profile. You may also be able to see which other players have viewed your Sleeperbot Profile.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Connecting with third party social networks<ul>
											<li>You can choose to log into Sleeperbot using your pre-approved 3rd party websites, apps, or social networks (“external accounts”). If you do this, you will be able to use your external accounts to log in on multiple devices and
												synchronise progress across those devices. We will receive some of your external account information and exactly what information we receive will depend on your settings and what is available to us. We may use this information for the
												purposes described in this privacy policy, including in order to advertise to you or your friends. This may also allow you to access other functionality in our games and other services, such as inviting friends to play, asking other
												players for credits and 1-2-1 messaging. If we implement a Facebook login, logging in with your Facebook account will not allow us to post anything to your Facebook page without your permission.</li>
											<li>In the future we may also allow you to associate your Sleeperbot Profile with other social network accounts and use your log in details for that account to log into your Sleeperbot Profile. Where we do this, either we or your social
												network service provider will let you know what information we will receive about you from that social network.</li>
											<li>Where you connect or associate your Sleeperbot Profile with any third party social network or platform, that social network applications or platform will provide certain information about you to us. These social networks and platforms
												are created and maintained by a third party which is not a part of, or controlled by Blitz Studios, Inc.. We may use this data for the purposes described in this privacy policy, including in order to advertise to you or your friends. You
												should ensure that you read the third party social network or platform's terms of service and privacy policies to understand how they treat your data and what information they might share with us.</li>
											<li>You can make changes to what data a third party social network or platform shares with us, or stop our Services interacting with that social network or platform by adjusting your settings with that third party provider, however you may
												find you are not able to enjoy all of the same features of our Services.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>4. How do we use the information that we have about you?<ul>

										purchases, storing your progress through our games, enabling social network integration, providing customer service support when you need it. We also use your information in connection with our advertising purposes. For more information, see

												reserve the right to prevent your use of our chat service(s) or to block the sending of any message for any reason. We also reserve the right to delete or modify any messages you send for any reason. We will not use the content of your
												chat messages for any other purpose.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Marketing and promotion<ul>

												behalf. For example, we might send you information about merchandise relating to our Services. If you do not want us to use your information in this way please let us know by contacting us at support@sleeper.app.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Customer Services<ul>
											<li>We use your information, including data that you provide directly to us in communications, to provide you with support through our customer service channels when you need it. We may also use it to contact you, for example as part of
												customer service or to send you updates about our games and services. Finally, we will use your data to manage your account and relationship with us and improving your experience when you use our Services.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Analytics and Research<ul>
											<li>We use analytics tools, which may include third party analytics tools, to collect information about how you play our games and those tools may use cookies or other similar tracking technologies. We may use your data to carry out
												research, surveys or to engage directly with you, for example by sending you communications (including by email), for these purposes. We may also create reports, analysis or similar services for use by us for the purposes of research or
												business intelligence, for example to track potential problems or trends with our Services, or to test out new game features and content.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Social and Community<ul>
											<li>We have a number of social and community channels which we use to communicate with our players. If you choose to interact with those channels, we will receive your information and use it in connection with those channels, including to
												engage with you, and we may also republish your posts to those channels.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Competitions<ul>
											<li>From time to time we may run competitions, including in games and via our community channels. Those competitions will have their own specific terms and conditions, but we will use personal information that you provide in relation to
												that competition for the purposes of running the competition.We may also publish the names and entries of competition entrants.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Cheating, crime and fraud prevention<ul>
											<li>We may use personal data that we hold to prevent cheating, crime or fraud. We may also need to pass your information to fraud prevention agencies and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention, such as the police.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Legal uses<ul>
											<li>We may use your data as required or permitted by any applicable law. As a specific example, if you live in the European Union, this would include for the purpose of providing VAT invoices where we are required to do so by law or where
												requested by you.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>5. Advertising and promotion<ul>
									<li>What adverts you may see as a result of playing our games or using our Services<ul>
											<li>We promote our own games and services in a number of ways. That might include cross promoting one of our games while you are playing a different game of ours. It might also include advertising our games within websites and other media
												published by others, or sending you marketing materials by email.</li>
											<li>Like many companies, we may use information about you in connection with advertising. This includes using information that we have about you, such as the games you play, to try to make sure you only see advertising that might be of
												interest to you. For example, if we know you fantasy football, we might suggest that you download any advice or research apps we may have relevant to fantasy football. We may also use the information that we have about you to help a third
												party deliver advertisements that are tailored to you based on a determination of your characteristics or interests by us based on the information that we have about you.</li>
											<li>As well as advertisements for our own goods and services, we may also facilitate third parties to optimise their advertising of their own goods and services by helping them to target those ads to those that might be most interested in
												them. These advertisements may be shown within our games or within websites and other media which are published by others and optimised by us or using our information. This is done using anonymised information and we won't hand over or
												sell any of your personal information to third party advertisers.</li>
											<li>We will also use information about your particular device in order to show you adverts which work properly on that device, or to measure the effectiveness of our ad campaigns and we may also retain information about how many times you
												have seen a particular advertisement so we can stop you from seeing it too many times.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Advertising partners<ul>
											<li>When we advertise our games in games or media published by other companies, we may use various third party advertising partners, including ad exchanges, ad networks and ad servers.</li>
											<li>Our advertising partners help us to serve advertisements to you. Some of this technology also helps us to make decisions as to whether or not to show a particular advert to you - for example, by informing us that you have shown an
												interest in similar goods or services previously.</li>
											<li>Our advertising partners may collect information about you when you use our services or the services of others. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection of your information by our advertising partners, and we therefore
												recommend that you review their privacy policies for more information. You can find out more in "How to adjust your preferences" below.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>How do ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies work?<ul>
											<li>Advertisers on mobile devices sometimes use advertising (or ad) identifiers to enable and optimise their advertising. Ad identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal device identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID
												for advertising, or IDFA. See below for you can reset these identifiers or indicate your preference that they should not be used for advertising purposes.</li>
											<li>We and third parties who advertise on our Services may use cookies or similar technologies such as tracking pixels in their advertising. These technologies operate either by: (i) placing a small file which stores some information on
												your computer or mobile device; and/or (ii) by accessing information on your device. These technologies allow the collection of data, such as your device's model, operating system and screen size, the other applications installed on your
												device, and information about how you use our services.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>How to adjust your preferences<ul>
											<li>You can choose to prevent your device's ad identifier being used for interest based advertising, or you can reset your device's ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary from device to device but you will
												usually find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings.</li>
											<li>You can disable cookies through your web or phone browser settings.</li>
											<li>If you live in the USA, Europe or Canada, you can also opt-out from the collection of your information by some or all of our advertising partners who participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting
												http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (for US users),http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ (for European users) or http://youradchoices.ca/choices (for Canadian users). You can also click on the AdChoices logo within an advertisement (where
												available).</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Although we and our advertising partners use ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies to enable us and third parties to provide more relevant advertising to you, these technologies also:<ul>
											<li>allow us to recognise you and your device;</li>
											<li>allow our Services to interact with a third party social network or platform (where you have chosen to allow such interaction);</li>
											<li>allow our payment processors to process your payment instructions; and</li>
											<li>enable us and third parties to provide you with more customized services, for example to provide our services in the correct language.</li>
											<li>As a result, if you choose to adjust your preferences in order to prevent these technologies, you may find that you cannot enjoy the full use of our services.</li>
											<li>Please note that adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive adverts, it only means the adverts you do see will be less relevant to your interests.</li>
											<li>Alternatively, if you do not wish us to collect data as described in this section, you should stop using our services.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

									<li>In addition to the other disclosures described in this privacy policy, we will also share your information as described in this section.</li>
									<li>We will share your information:<ul>
											<li>where we have your consent to do so (including as set out in this Privacy Policy);</li>
											<li>as reasonably necessary in order to provide the Services to you (for example, by providing your personal information to suppliers we may use to fulfil the Services or to communicate with you);</li>
											<li>where it is necessary to carry out your instructions (for example, to process a payment instruction we must provide your personal information to our payment processors);</li>
											<li>where your data is on an anonymous and aggregated basis, meaning you could not be personally identified from it;</li>
											<li>when you submit information as part of a competition or otherwise interact with our social media channels (for example, by providing a testimonial about one of our Services) we may publish the information you submitted, alongside your
												name and home country on our website(s) and social media channels;</li>
											<li>as we reasonably believe is permitted by law or regulation or as is necessary to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions and/or any other agreement with you; or to protect the rights,

										</ul>
									</li>

										information such as high scores. Depending on your settings in your social network or Sleeperbot account, other information in your profile may be shared with other players. Also, other players will be able to see anything that you post to
